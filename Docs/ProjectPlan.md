## 1 Introduction
We are creating a simple, single-user job offer comparison app in order to compare job offers benefits, in different locations, and other aspects beyond salary.

## 2 Process Description

### Design and Planning
- Create a basic design for the application and plan the implementation of application. The Design documentation will describe how the application will work, the Planning documents will describe how we plan to get there.
- Project Requirements
- design.pdf, design-description.md, DesignDocument.md, ExtraRequirements.md, ProjectPlan.md, and TestPlan.md


### Initial Development
- Create a preliminary application and test suite. Using our design and planning documents, we will start developing the application. The main deliverable from this step is a MVP for the app.
- design.pdf, design-description.md, DesignDocument.md, ExtraRequirements.md, ProjectPlan.md, and TestPlan.md
- JobCompare6300/app (alpha)

### Test and Improve
- We will run our test suite and any sanity checks to make sure the application is working. We will continue to fix bugs and improve features related to the application. We may also enhance tests if we find that they are insufficient.
- JobCompare6300/app (alpha)
- JobCompare6300/app (beta), test plan with initial results, UserManual.md

### Develop, Test, and Finalize
- We will finalize the features that our application will have. In addition, we will improve any related aspects, such as tests, documentation, etc. The main deliverable from this step is a final deployment ready application.
