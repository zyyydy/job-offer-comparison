# Test Plan

**Authors**: Vincent Hu, Sarah Kidd, Wenjuan Li, Ying Zhou

**Version** D3.0

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Our testing approach would adhere to the commonly adopted Agile methodology with testing done throughout the development life cycle. We plan to implement automated unit test as often as possible during development process, meanwhile sanity checks will be handled manually. System integration testing would be performed once integration of UI and backend completes, while regression testing would be conducted after any bug fixes.
We have automated few scenarios using Android test automation framework - Espresso for System integration and Regression testing, rest scenarios will be performed manually.
Each individual in the team would share the responsibility of testing activities.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We would select different set of test cases through the development life cycle.
#### Unit Test
Unit test would be performed during development of components to ensure the component level functionality is working as expected. Thus, unit test cases would be designed during development phase, mock data can be used. White-box techniques such as data flow testing would be used.
#### Integration and System Test
Test cases used for Integration and System test are prepared based on the functional requirements, same are outlined in **2 Test Case** section. We used black-box techniques such as Boundary value analysis to check the data range of specific field.
Besides, we also used Use cases testing techniques by referring to the use cases prepared to ensure coverage.
#### Regression Test
Regression test would be performed for any bug fixes after System/functional test, the test cases would be selected from the System test case suite based on the fix and impact.
#### Non-functional Test
Considering the time constrains, the non-functional testing such as performance and load test is out of scope for current assignment. We would plan that in future as part of enhancement.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
The testing will consist of the tests prepared based on the functional requirements of the application. Both positive and negative scenarios would be considered during case preparation for unit test and system test.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
Aside from the original design planning process, we will track bug and enhancement requests through Github using BugReport.

### 1.5 Technology
We have used Android test automation framework - Espresso to automate some scenarios as part of integration test, system test and regression test.

## 2 Test Cases

Below is list of test cases designed for reference during functional testing and regression testing. The steps and expected results are written in modern Gherkin language to make them easier to read.
